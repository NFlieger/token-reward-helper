Token Reward Helper
--------------------------------------

This addons helps you decide if you need a token for a reward or not by adding tooltips for the rewards of token when you mouse over the token.
In addition to the normal tooltip of the token another tooltip will be shown for each possible reward you are eligible to wear. Normaly this will filter the possible rewards for set token to 1 at most. You can bypass this behaviour by holding any modifier (SHIFT, ALT, CTRL).

If you click on linked reward tokens in chat, a filtered list of rewards usable by you will be shown as well.
