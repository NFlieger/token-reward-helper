Token Reward Helper
--------------------------------------

This addons helps you decide if you need a token for a reward or not by adding tooltips for the rewards of token when you mouse over the token.
In addition to the normal tooltip of the token another tooltip will be shown for each possible reward you are eligible to wear. Normaly this will filter the possible rewards for set token to 1 at most. You can bypass this behaviour by holding any modifier (SHIFT, ALT, CTRL).

If you click on linked reward tokens in chat, a filtered list of rewards usable by you will be shown as well.

To change the alignment of the Reward Tooltip in relation to the Token Tooltip, type `/trh align`.

Currently implemented tokens:

* Head of Onyxia
* Head of Nefarian
* ZG: Heart of Hakkar
* ZG: Primal Hakkari Tokens
* AQ20: Head of Ossirian the Unscarred
* AQ20: Qiraji Tokens

Tokens from AQ40 and Naxx will be added soon.
Maybe an optional unfiltered list of rewards will be added to chat links as well, if i get an idea on how to activate that option while still using the normal clicking.
