Tooltip alignment

* Tooltip alignment is now configurable to TOP or BOTTOM (default TOP)
* to switch tooltip alignment use /trh align <TOP|BOTTOM> (also added to the CLI help)
* this setting will be saved account wide

Reward tooltips are no longer bound to the screen to prevent overlapping with the token tooltip.
